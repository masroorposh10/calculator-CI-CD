# Calculator CI/CD
This project demonstrates a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline for a calculator application using YAML, Terraform, and GitHub Workflows. The pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring efficient development and delivery of the calculator application.

# Features
Calculator Application: The project includes a calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# CI/CD Pipeline: 
The CI/CD pipeline utilizes GitHub Actions and workflows to automate various stages of the software development lifecycle, including building, testing, and deploying the calculator application.

Infrastructure as Code: Terraform is used to define the infrastructure components required for the calculator application, such as cloud resources, networking, and security settings. Infrastructure is provisioned and managed through Terraform configuration files.

# Prerequisites
GitHub account (https://github.com)
Terraform installed locally (https://www.terraform.io)
Cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) for deploying the calculator infrastructure
